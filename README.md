# WebStrategyYut
WebStrategyYut is a web-based implementation of the traditional Korean board game "Yutnori" with advanced rules from the TV show "The Genius".
Developed using Node.js, the game can be played directly in the web browser.
Please note that the current implementation is a prototype and may contain bugs, as it was created as a proof of concept.
Some parts of the code were written using ChatGPT.
Additionally, some features may not be fully implemented and there may be slight differences from the original rules.
